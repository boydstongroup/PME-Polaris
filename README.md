## Introduction

The Polaris PME 3D printer enables the use of custom materials without the need for expensive filamentation processes. It also facilitates recycling and compositing of bespoke polymers with specific physical or chemical properties. The conversion process involves 3D printing custom parts, soldering electrical components, and assembling the printer. This guide aims to help researchers and enthusiasts modify a Creality Ender-3 FFF 3D printer to build an affordable and reliable PME printing system.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a functioning FFF 3D printer (for printing custom parts)
- Necessary parts and tools as specified in the bill of materials
- Basic technical knowledge (soldering, assembling, etc.)

## Conversion Process

1. Clone the [PME-Polaris repository](https://github.com/boydstongroup/PME-Polaris.git) and explore the README file for detailed information about the bill of materials and 3D models.
2. Print the custom parts using the provided 3D models.
3. Gather all necessary components and tools.
4. Follow the step-by-step conversion guide to assemble your Polaris PME 3D printer.
5. Set up the firmware and software for the printer.
6. Test and calibrate the PME 3D printer according to the provided instructions.

## Contribution

The PME project is actively developed, and contributions from the open-source community are welcome. We encourage researchers and enthusiasts to modify, improve, and share their work to advance the field of 3D printing. If you have any questions, suggestions, or improvements, please submit an issue or pull request to the [PME-Polaris repository](https://github.com/boydstongroup/PME-Polaris.git).
